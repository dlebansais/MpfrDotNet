# Instructions
+ Install Visual Studio 2019.
+ Clone and build [my fork of mpir](https://github.com/dlebansais/mpir).
+ Clone this repository locally. Make sure the clone sits in the same root directory as mpir (ex: `/MyProjects/mpir` and `/MyProjects/mpfr`).
+ Open `./build.vs19/dll_mpfr.sln` with Visual Studio 2019.
+ Select the `Debug` or `Release` build.
+ Rebuild the solution.

Resulting files are in the `./dll` subdirectory.
